# Public MVP Spec & Data Contract v1

> **Status:** documentation only. This is the **Phase 3** deliverable (per
> `docs/product-vision.md` §6 roadmap): a forward-looking UX specification and an explicit
> **data contract** that feeds the Claude Design / UI-concept phase. It changes no code,
> tests, persistence, or model behavior.
>
> **Audience:** product + design (Claude Design) + engineering.
>
> **Replaces** the old "UI audit" idea. The current app is generic Lovable scaffolding with
> no real design, so there is nothing worth cataloguing in depth. Section 1 is a brief
> keep/replace/hide inventory; the rest of the document is the forward-looking spec.
>
> **Companion docs:** `docs/public-mvp-scope-v1.md` (the de-facto PRD — inputs/outputs/risks),
> `docs/product-vision.md` (direction), `docs/model-primitives-v1.md` (conceptual model),
> `src/lib/finance/MODEL.md` (engine note), `src/lib/finance/simpleInputs.ts` (the typed
> simple-input surface this spec builds on).

## Product context assumed throughout

- **One app, one engine.** The public **simple flow is the default entry**; the existing
  advanced surface lives behind an opt-in **"Advanced" door** — not a separate app or model.
- **Public UI is Danish** (brand **"Frihedsmodel"**); internal product name is **Economic
  Freedom Explorer**. All proposed user-facing copy below is therefore in Danish; the spec
  prose is English to match the existing docs.
- **"Simple" = a reduced input/output surface** over the real engine
  (`src/lib/finance/simpleInputs.ts`), never a second model.
- **Visual design starts fresh.** Nothing in the current generic UI is preserved. What we
  keep is the **engine, the store, the `simpleInputs` mapping, persistence, and the tested
  pipeline.**

---

## 1. Keep / replace / hide (brief inventory)

This is an inventory of what to reuse vs. rebuild — not a deep audit. Grounded in the
current source: routes in `src/App.tsx`, pages in `src/pages/`, state in
`src/store/financeStore.ts`, engine in `src/lib/finance/`.

| Area | Decision | What & why |
|---|---|---|
| Finance engine — `src/lib/finance/*` (`projection.ts`, `kpis.ts`, `sanity.ts`, `stress.ts`, `tax.ts`, `fire.ts`, `defaults.ts`, `types.ts`) | **KEEP** | Correct, well-tested, invariant-protected. The product's core value. Never forked for the public path. |
| Runtime state + persistence — `src/store/financeStore.ts`, `zustand/persist` (`finance-tool.v1`), `MODEL_VERSION`/`migrate()` | **KEEP** | Proven local-first persistence with versioned migration. The public flow reads/writes through it. |
| Simple-input mapping — `src/lib/finance/simpleInputs.ts` (`SimplePublicInputs`, `toScenarioInputs`, `toAssumptions`, `toScenario`, `DEFAULT_SIMPLE_INPUTS`) | **KEEP** | The exact bridge the public UI sits on. This spec's data contract (§4) is its surface. |
| Cloud overlay — `src/lib/cloud/*`, `/cloud`, `/auth` (optional Supabase save/login, RLS) | **KEEP (optional, deferred in flow)** | Works today and is offline-optional. Not on the first-use path; surfaced as optional "save to cloud" later. |
| Tested pipeline — Vitest unit/scenario suites + Playwright e2e + CI gate | **KEEP** | The safety net. New public UI adds e2e coverage; it must not weaken existing tests. |
| Public page/route UI + visual layer — `Dashboard`, `Inputs`, `Assumptions`, `Projection`, `Report`, the `AppShell` nav, generic Lovable `Index.tsx` | **REPLACE** | Generic scaffolding, no design, exposes the full advanced model immediately. The public path is rebuilt from this spec. |
| Advanced routes/features — `/scenarios`, `/snapshots`, `/life-events`, `/fire`, `/countries`, full year-by-year tables, holding/business, ASK, `depotTax`, custom withdrawal order, detailed tax buckets, stress modifiers | **HIDE behind Advanced door** | Real and valuable, but advanced/locale-specific. Stays in the engine + Advanced mode; never on first use (CLAUDE.md §3 rule 7). |
| `/debug/model-validation` (`ModelValidation` page, `runModelValidation()`) | **HIDE (internal only)** | Engineering/test tooling. Never public-facing (scope §4 "internal/debug"). |

**Net:** keep everything below the UI (engine, store, mapping, persistence, tests);
rebuild the public UI surface from scratch; keep advanced + debug surfaces but off the
default path.

## 2. Public MVP flow (answer-first journey)

Reconciled with `docs/public-mvp-scope-v1.md` §2. The journey is **answer-first**: a usable
result appears on sensible defaults before the user tunes anything, then invites refinement.
All amounts are **real terms / today's money (nutidskroner)**.

| # | Step | Purpose | What the user sees |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Intro / framing** | Set expectation: this is an estimate, not advice; all amounts are in today's money. | One calm screen: headline question *"Hvornår kan du blive økonomisk fri?"*, one-line framing, a single primary CTA to start. A persistent, unobtrusive single global disclaimer (see §5). |
| 2 | **Simple inputs** | Collect the minimal input set (§4) with defaults pre-filled so a result is always reachable. | One short form/card fitting one screen: age, horizon, income, spending, current investments, monthly saving, pension balance + access age, expected return, desired stop age. Defaults from `DEFAULT_SIMPLE_INPUTS`. |
| 3 | **Answer-first result** | Give the headline answer immediately. | A result hero: status badge (on track / tight / not yet) + the headline number **earliest sustainable stop age**, plus a one-line plain-language takeaway. |
| 4 | **Projection over time** | Make the path tangible. | A simple net-worth-over-time chart with the planned stop age marked and a one-line takeaway ("Dine penge rækker til alder X" / "slipper op ved alder Y"). Anchor points are **horizon-relative** (stop/FI age, pension access age, end of horizon) — never a hardcoded age that may fall outside the projection (see §4.2). |
| 5 | **First bottleneck** | Surface the single most important constraint. | A card naming the **first shortfall age** and the **monthly gap in that year** (sourced from the first shortfall year itself, not an after-stop average — see §4.2), in plain language ("Fra alder 86 mangler du 18.255 kr/md"). If no shortfall: a reassuring "ingen flaskehals fundet". |
| 6 | **Adjust a few levers** | Let the user *feel* the trade-offs. | 2–3 live controls (monthly spending, monthly saving, stop age). Result + chart + bottleneck update live. Advanced depth stays behind the Advanced door. |
| 7 | **Save / export (optional)** | Let the user keep or share a result. No account required for the basic path. | Local save + JSON export; optional "save to cloud" (login) as a clearly secondary action. |

Advanced depth (extra accounts, tax detail, business capital, scenarios, snapshots,
countries) is a **separate opt-in "Advanced" door**, never on the main path.

## 3. Screens & cards for Claude Design

Concrete structural brief. For each screen: the cards/sections, what each shows, and what
is hidden/deferred. This is what a designer builds from. Copy shown is indicative Danish
(see §5 for tone); final microcopy is a copy pass, not locked here.

### Screen A — Intro / framing
- **Hero card:** product brand "Frihedsmodel", headline question, one-line framing, primary
  CTA (*"Kom i gang"*).
- **Trust strip (persistent):** the single global disclaimer "En forenklet beregning ud fra
  dine egne tal og antagelser. Tag tallene som et kvalificeret billede, ikke en garanti, og
  ikke som økonomisk rådgivning." + "Alle beløb er i nutidskroner."
- *Hidden/deferred:* sign-in, advanced mode entry (a small, low-emphasis link only).

### Screen B — Simple inputs
- **Input card "Om dig":** current age, planning horizon (life expectancy).
- **Input card "Økonomi i dag":** annual gross income, monthly spending.
- **Input card "Opsparing & investering":** current investments, monthly saving.
- **Input card "Pension":** pension balance, pension access age.
- **Input card "Antagelser & mål":** expected real return (one field), desired stop age,
  (optional) FI target minimum net worth.
- **Primary action:** *"Se mit resultat"*. Defaults pre-filled so this is reachable instantly.
- *Hidden/deferred:* multiple accounts, ASK/depot tax, cash buffer, part-time/bridge income,
  state pension, ongoing pension contributions, annuities, debt, life events, withdrawal
  order, per-assumption confidence. (All mapped to safe off/zero by `toScenarioInputs`.)

### Screen C — Result (answer-first dashboard)
- **Status hero card:** status badge (valid / tight / not yet) + headline **earliest
  sustainable stop age** + one-line takeaway. Maps from `modelStatus` + `earliestSustainableStopAge`.
- **Key numbers card:** capital at **horizon-relative anchors** — planned stop/FI age,
  pension access age, and end of horizon — each a *number + one sentence*. Do **not** use a
  hardcoded calendar age (e.g. 65) that may not exist in the projection (see §4.2 for why
  `capitalAt65` is unsafe).
- **Projection chart card:** net worth over time, planned stop age marked, plain takeaway line.
- **First bottleneck card:** first shortfall age + the **monthly gap in that year**
  (`shortfallAmount / 12` from the first shortfall `YearRow`, **not** the after-stop average),
  or "ingen flaskehals".
- **Robustness card:** "Hvor solid er planen?" — a 0–100 robustness score (`financialRobustness`)
  + the top 3 drivers (helps/hurts) via the **public-safe drivers adapter** (§4.5) — never raw
  `robustnessBreakdown`, which always includes advanced/internal factors (holding, buffer).
- **Warnings card (conditional):** plain-language cautions produced by a **public-safe
  warnings adapter** over `sanityChecks()` + a status→copy mapping over `modelStatus` —
  never raw `sanityChecks()` output, raw check IDs, or `modelStatusReason` verbatim. Only
  allowlisted checks surface (see §4.4); advanced/DK/internal checks are filtered out.
- **"How is this calculated?" affordance:** each headline number links to a one-paragraph
  explainer (real terms, what FI age means, what robustness means).
- *Hidden/deferred:* full year-by-year `YearRow[]` table, per-bucket balances, tax
  breakdowns, withdrawal audit, scenario comparison, country analysis, raw audit JSON,
  `/debug/model-validation`.

### Screen D — Adjust levers (may be inline on Screen C)
- **Lever controls:** monthly spending, monthly saving, stop age (2–3 controls, live recompute).
- **Live result echo:** status badge + stop age + bottleneck update as the user drags.
- *Hidden/deferred:* stress modifiers, custom scenarios, assumption-by-assumption editing.

### Screen E — Save / export (optional, secondary)
- **Local save card:** name + save to `localStorage`.
- **Export card:** download JSON summary.
- **Cloud (optional) card:** "Gem i skyen" → login (Supabase). Clearly secondary; never required.
- *Hidden/deferred:* snapshot history + comparison UI, share links, accounts-first flows.

### The Advanced door (out of MVP scope, present as a link only)
- A single low-emphasis entry ("Avanceret") that leads to the existing advanced surface
  (scenarios, snapshots, life events, FIRE, countries, full tables). Not designed in this
  spec — it reuses the current advanced pages until a later phase.

---

## 4. Public data contract

The explicit handoff for Claude Design. Two halves: the **input surface** (what the UI
collects) and the **output surface** (what the result UI must show), plus **example
fixtures** to design against.

### 4.0 Two cross-cutting rules (apply to every output)

These two rules govern **every** row of the output surface. They exist because the engine's
KPIs are built for the advanced/internal surface, where out-of-horizon ages silently return
`0` and lists/text contain advanced/DK/internal items. The public path must never inherit
those behaviours. Every row in §4.2 has been audited against both rules.

- **R1 — Horizon-boundary rule.** The projection runs **exactly `[currentAge, lifeExpectancy]`**
  (`projection.ts`: `age = currentAge + i` for `i` in `0 .. lifeExpectancy − currentAge`).
  Every **age-anchored** output must be explicitly bounded to that range, with a **defined
  conditional/fallback** when the age falls outside it. Several KPIs use the pattern
  `years.find(y => y.age === A)?.netWorth ?? 0`, which returns a real-looking **`0`** when
  age `A` is out of horizon (e.g. `capitalAt65`, and `capitalAtStopAge` if `stopAge` is out
  of range). The public UI must guard the age, not trust the `?? 0`.
  - **Inverse (just as important): a fixed-age KPI must never be repurposed as a
    horizon-relative anchor.** Horizon-relative anchors — **start** (`currentAge`), **end**
    (`lifeExpectancy`), **FI/stop age**, **pension access age** — are derived from the **actual
    `YearRow` in the projection series** (e.g. the **last** `YearRow` for the end of the plan).
    Fixed-age KPIs (`capitalAt65`, `capitalAt95`) are only valid **when that specific age lies
    within `[currentAge, lifeExpectancy]`**, and even then they mean "capital at that calendar
    age", never "start/end/FI/pension of the plan". In particular `capitalAt95 =
    years.find(y => y.age === 95) ?? years[last]` is the **age-95** figure whenever
    `lifeExpectancy ≥ 95` (the input range allows up to 110), and only coincidentally equals the
    plan's end when `lifeExpectancy ≤ 95` — so it must **not** back the end-of-horizon card.
- **R2 — Public-safe-adapter rule.** **No raw engine list or text** is exposed on the public
  path — not warnings (`sanityChecks()`), not robustness drivers (`robustnessBreakdown`), not
  assumption-confidence drivers (`confidenceBreakdown`), not status reasons
  (`modelStatusReason`). Each passes a **default-deny adapter** that (a) filters out
  advanced/DK/internal items and (b) translates survivors to public-facing Danish copy.
  Adapters are specified in §4.4 (warnings + status) and §4.5 (drivers).

### 4.1 Input surface — `SimplePublicInputs`

The exact typed fields from `src/lib/finance/simpleInputs.ts`. All monetary values are
**DKK, real terms (today's money)**. Defaults are `DEFAULT_SIMPLE_INPUTS`.

| Field | Type / unit | Default | Meaning | Suggested input range* |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `currentAge` | integer years | 35 | Start of the projection horizon | 18–75 |
| `lifeExpectancy` | integer years | 90 | Planning horizon end age | `currentAge+1`–110; default ~90 |
| `annualIncome` | DKK / year, gross | 500,000 | Current gross annual income | 0–5,000,000 |
| `monthlySpending` | DKK / month, net | 20,000 | Desired monthly spending (the dominant lever) | 0–200,000 |
| `currentInvestments` | DKK | 200,000 | What you've invested so far | 0–50,000,000 |
| `monthlySavings` | DKK / month | 8,000 | Ongoing monthly saving into investments | 0–500,000 |
| `pensionBalance` | DKK | 300,000 | Current pension balance | 0–50,000,000 |
| `pensionAccessAge` | integer years | 67 | Age pension becomes accessible / starts paying | 50–80 |
| `expectedRealReturn` | decimal (0.04 = 4%) | 0.04 | One simple real-return field, mapped to all per-bucket returns | 0.00–0.10 |
| `desiredStopAge` | integer years | 60 | Desired stop / retirement age (the goal) | `currentAge`–`lifeExpectancy` |
| `fiTargetMinNetWorth?` | DKK, optional | omitted ⇒ 0 | Optional FI target: minimum net worth at end of horizon | 0–50,000,000 |

\* **Ranges are design guidance, not yet enforced.** `simpleInputs.ts` does no validation;
input validation/clamping is an **open item for Phase 7** (mid-build stress/security gate).
Design should assume validation will exist (e.g. "stop age must be ≥ current age") and show
inline error states accordingly.

**Mapping notes (so design understands the simplifications):** the simple form maps to a
single salary stream while working; one investment account (no ASK/depot-tax/cash buffer);
a pension as a starting balance + access age (no ongoing contributions/annuity); business/
holding capital, debt, life events, part-time income, state pension, and advanced
withdrawal/allocation policies are all set to safe off/zero. These are surface choices in
`toScenarioInputs` — the engine and existing scenarios are unchanged.

### 4.2 Output surface — what the result UI must show

The MVP shows a clear subset of `KPIs` (from `src/lib/finance/types.ts`) plus
`sanityChecks()`. Each output is a **number + a plain sentence** (scope §4 rule).

| Output | Source field (`KPIs.*`) | Type / unit | Plain-language meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Earliest sustainable stop age | `earliestSustainableStopAge` | integer years or `null` | "Du kan tidligst stoppe ved alder X" (or "ikke på sporet endnu" when `null`) |
| Planned stop age (echo of input) | `plannedStopAge` | integer years | The stop age the user chose, for comparison with the earliest sustainable one |
| Capital at planned stop/FI age | `capitalAtStopAge` | DKK | "N ved din planlagte stop-alder". **R1:** `capitalAtStopAge = yAtStop?.netWorth ?? 0`, so it silently returns 0 if `stopAge` is out of horizon. Show only when `currentAge ≤ stopAge ≤ lifeExpectancy` (which §4.1 input validation must enforce); never trust the `?? 0`. |
| Capital at pension access age | net worth of the `YearRow` at `pensionAccessAge` (read from the projection series; **not** a precomputed KPI) | DKK | "N når din pension bliver tilgængelig (alder {pensionAccessAge})". **R1:** the projection only spans `[currentAge, lifeExpectancy]`, so there is **no** `YearRow` when `pensionAccessAge < currentAge`. Render the card only when `currentAge ≤ pensionAccessAge ≤ lifeExpectancy`. **Fallbacks:** if `pensionAccessAge < currentAge` (pension already accessible) → show capital at `currentAge` with copy "Din pension er allerede tilgængelig", **or** omit the card; if `pensionAccessAge > lifeExpectancy` (never opens in horizon) → omit the card. |
| Capital at end of horizon | net worth of the **last projected `YearRow`** (net worth at `lifeExpectancy`), read directly from the projection series — **not** `capitalAt95` | DKK | "N ved planperiodens slutning". **R1 (inverse):** do **not** use `capitalAt95` here — it is `years.find(age===95) ?? years[last]`, i.e. the **age-95** figure whenever `lifeExpectancy ≥ 95` (the input range allows up to 110), and only coincides with the plan's end when `lifeExpectancy ≤ 95`. Always source the end-of-horizon anchor from the last `YearRow` (same pattern as the pension-access anchor). |
| First shortfall age | `firstShortfallAge` | integer years or `null` | "Første år pengene ikke rækker: alder Y" (or none) |
| **Monthly gap at the first bottleneck** | `shortfallAmount / 12` of the **first shortfall `YearRow`** (`years.find(y => y.shortfall)`; equivalently that row's `monthlyGap`) | DKK / month | "Fra alder Y mangler du G kr/md" — the gap **in that year**, the number the bottleneck card shows |
| After-stop average monthly gap (optional) | `monthlyGapAfterStop` | DKK / month | The **average** monthly gap across all years from stop age onward — a different, smaller number. If shown at all, label it explicitly as an average ("gns. efter stop"); never use it as the bottleneck gap. |
| Status | `modelStatus` | `valid` / `target_missed` / `invalid` | One clear badge + one-line reason via a **status→public-copy mapping** (§4.4). Never show `modelStatusReason` verbatim — it is raw Danish engine text. |
| Robustness score | `financialRobustness` | 0–100 | "Hvor solid er planen?" with a short explainer |
| Assumption confidence | `assumptionConfidence` | 0–100 | "Hvor meget hviler planen på optimistiske antagelser?" |
| Top drivers (help/hurt) | a **public-safe adapter** over `robustnessBreakdown` (§4.5) | allowlisted, plain Danish copy | "Hvad hjælper / hvad trækker ned" — show top 3–5. **R2:** never point the UI at raw `robustnessBreakdown`; it always contains advanced/internal factors (e.g. the holding-dependency factor, present even when holding = 0). |
| Warnings | a **public-safe adapter** over `sanityChecks()` (§4.4) | allowlisted, plain Danish copy | Plain-language cautions, only when relevant — never raw `sanityChecks()` output |

Optional, if shown: `minNetWorthAtEnd`, `endShortfallVsTarget` (only meaningful when the
user set `fiTargetMinNetWorth`). **Never public-facing:** `firstFinancingIssueKind/Amount`,
`unfinancedHoldingDebt/Years`, full `YearRow[]`, raw audit JSON, `runModelValidation()`,
`modelStatusReason` (raw text), `robustnessBreakdown`/`confidenceBreakdown` as raw lists
(use the §4.5 adapter), and the fixed-age KPIs `capitalAt65` and `capitalAt95` as anchors
(see below).

**Per-row audit against R1 / R2.** Age-anchored rows (R1): *capital at stop/FI age* (guard
`stopAge` in horizon — see row), *capital at pension access age* (guard + fallbacks — see
row), *capital at end of horizon* (derived from the **last `YearRow`**, not `capitalAt95` —
see row; `capitalAt95` is a fixed-age KPI and is wrong for `lifeExpectancy > 95`).
Scalar age values that only need null/﻿out-of-range display handling, not a `YearRow` lookup:
*earliest sustainable stop age* (`null` → "ikke på sporet endnu"), *planned stop age* (echo
of a validated input), *first shortfall age* (`null` → no bottleneck). List/text rows (R2):
*status* → §4.4 mapping, *warnings* → §4.4 adapter, *top drivers* → §4.5 adapter. Plain
scalars with no boundary/adapter risk: *robustness score*, *assumption confidence*,
*after-stop average gap*, *monthly gap at first bottleneck* (guarded by `firstShortfallAge`
being non-null).

**Why not the fixed-age KPIs (`capitalAt65`, `capitalAt95`)?** Two distinct failure modes, both
covered by R1: (1) `capitalAt65 = years.find(y => y.age === 65)?.netWorth ?? 0` silently returns
**0** when age 65 is out of horizon (e.g. `currentAge > 65`, or a short horizon) — a real-looking
but false number. (2) `capitalAt95 = years.find(y => y.age === 95) ?? years[last]` is the **age-95**
figure when `lifeExpectancy ≥ 95`, so using it for the end-of-horizon card **mislabels** the age-95
value as "planperiodens slutning" for any plan running past 95. The public surface uses
horizon-relative anchors instead, each derived from the actual `YearRow` (start, end = last
`YearRow`, FI/stop age, pension access age). If a fixed-age card is ever kept, it must be
**conditional**: render only when that age is within `[currentAge, lifeExpectancy]`, label it by
the calendar age (not as start/end/FI), and otherwise fall back to a horizon-relative anchor. The
supported `currentAge`/`lifeExpectancy` range may stay broad; anchors must not assume any fixed age
is in the projection.

### 4.3 Example projected results (design fixtures)

Computed by tracing the engine (`toScenario`/`toAssumptions` → `project` → `deriveKPIs`/
`sanityChecks`) — via a temporary, uncommitted script; **no code was committed**. Numbers are
real-terms DKK. Use these as realistic design fixtures (one "not yet on track", one "on track").

> **The Value column holds illustrative, rounded example figures** (monetary ones marked with
> `≈`), for design only. The live UI — and any test — must render the **actual runtime-computed
> value** formatted in Danish convention (period as thousands separator, whole kroner), **never
> these rounded examples**. So the "Designed-for framing" copy uses a `{beløb}` placeholder for
> the runtime value rather than a hardcoded number; do not hardcode the example figures as
> rendered copy. (Per the copy rule in §5, the rendered figure carries no "ca." and uncertainty
> is handled once by the single global disclaimer, not per number.) Exact integer values — ages,
> scores, status — are shown directly.

**Fixture 1 — `DEFAULT_SIMPLE_INPUTS` persona (the default form state).**
Inputs: age 35, horizon 90, income 500,000, spending 20,000/md, investments 200,000,
saving 8,000/md, pension 300,000 @ access 67, return 4%, desired stop 60.

| Output | Value | Designed-for framing |
|---|---|---|
| `modelStatus` | `invalid` | Badge: "Ikke på sporet" |
| `plannedStopAge` | 60 | "Du vil gerne stoppe ved 60" |
| `earliestSustainableStopAge` | 62 | "Tidligst holdbare stop: 62" |
| Capital at stop age (`capitalAtStopAge`) | ≈ 4.240.000 kr | "{beløb} kr ved stop" |
| Capital at pension access age (67) | ≈ 3.580.000 kr | "{beløb} kr når pensionen åbner" |
| Capital at end of horizon (last `YearRow`, age 90) | 0 kr | "Formuen er brugt op inden planperiodens slutning". (Here `lifeExpectancy` 90 < 95, so this equals `capitalAt95` — but the card must source the last `YearRow`, not `capitalAt95`.) |
| `firstShortfallAge` | 86 | "Første flaskehals: alder 86" |
| **Monthly gap at first bottleneck** (year-86 `shortfallAmount / 12`) | ≈ 18.255 kr/md | "Fra alder 86 mangler du {beløb} kr/md" — this is the bottleneck-card number |
| After-stop average gap (`monthlyGapAfterStop`) | ≈ 3.170 kr/md | A different, smaller average across all years from stop; only show if explicitly labelled "gns. efter stop" |
| `financialRobustness` | 25 / 100 | "Lav robusthed" |
| `assumptionConfidence` | 75 / 100 | "Rimelig antagelsessikkerhed" |
| Top driver (via §4.5 adapter) | raw `robustnessBreakdown[0]` = "Cashflow-shortfall ved alder 86" (negative, critical) | Public copy: "Trækkes mest ned af: pengene slipper op ved 86." The raw list **also** contains "Lav margin til minimumsmål", "Lav kontant buffer" and "Lav afhængighed af holding" — all filtered out by the drivers adapter. |
| Warning (allowlisted) | `planned-over-cashflow` ("Planlagt opsparing overstiger cashflow i 25 år") | Surfaced via the §4.4 adapter as plain copy: "Du forsøger at spare mere op, end din økonomi tillader i 25 år." |

> Useful for design: this default persona is **deliberately not on track** — it exercises
> the "not yet" badge, a real bottleneck, and a low robustness score on first load. A lever
> nudge (lower spending or later stop) should move it toward valid.

**Fixture 2 — Higher-saver persona (an "on track" contrast).**
Inputs: age 35, horizon 90, income 650,000, spending 18,000/md, investments 600,000,
saving 15,000/md, pension 500,000 @ access 67, return 4%, desired stop 55.

| Output | Value | Designed-for framing |
|---|---|---|
| `modelStatus` | `valid` | Badge: "På sporet" |
| `plannedStopAge` | 55 | "Du vil gerne stoppe ved 55" |
| `earliestSustainableStopAge` | 48 | "Du kunne stoppe allerede ved 48" |
| Capital at stop age (`capitalAtStopAge`) | ≈ 8.070.000 kr | "{beløb} kr ved stop" |
| Capital at pension access age (67) | ≈ 9.500.000 kr | "{beløb} kr når pensionen åbner" |
| Capital at end of horizon (last `YearRow`, age 90) | ≈ 13.520.000 kr | "Formuen vokser planperioden ud". (Here `lifeExpectancy` 90 < 95, so this equals `capitalAt95`; the card must still source the last `YearRow`.) |
| `firstShortfallAge` | `null` | "Ingen flaskehals fundet" |
| Monthly gap at first bottleneck | — (no shortfall) | Bottleneck card hidden; show "ingen flaskehals" |
| After-stop average gap (`monthlyGapAfterStop`) | 0 kr/md | "Ingen mangel efter stop" |
| `financialRobustness` | 90 / 100 | "Høj robusthed" |
| `assumptionConfidence` | 76 / 100 | "Rimelig antagelsessikkerhed" |
| Top positive driver (via §4.5 adapter) | raw `robustnessBreakdown` includes "Ingen cashflow-shortfall" (positive) + "Komfortabel slutmargin" (positive); also "Lav kontant buffer" and "Lav afhængighed af holding" — the latter two filtered out | Public copy: "Forbruget er dækket hele perioden." / "God margin ved planperiodens slutning." |

> These two fixtures bracket the common cases: a plan that needs work and a comfortable
> plan. Design the result screen so both read clearly without redesign.

### 4.4 Public-safe warnings & status adapter

`sanityChecks()` and `modelStatusReason` are **internal, advanced, and DK-specific** by
design — they reference holding companies, ASK, folkepension, ratepension/livrente, part-time
income, family fund, debt double-counting, the stress-test "No Barma", and the internal
audit panel. **None of this raw output may reach the public path.** The public surface must
go through two small adapters that the onboarding/result PR will implement (UI-side, no
engine change):

**(a) Status → public copy** — map `modelStatus` (`valid` / `target_missed` / `invalid`)
to plain Danish (see §5). Never render `modelStatusReason` (raw engine text) verbatim.

**(b) Warnings allowlist** — a **default-deny** adapter: only checks whose `id` is on the
allowlist may surface, each rewritten to plain, jargon-free Danish. Everything else is
dropped. Match on the stable `id`, not the title text.

**Allowlist (may surface on the public path):**

| `sanityChecks()` id | Why it's public-safe | Public Danish copy (indicative) |
|---|---|---|
| `planned-over-cashflow` | Generic: the user is trying to save more than their cashflow allows. Drop the internal "Hybrid/Planlagt" wording. | "Du forsøger at spare mere op, end din økonomi tillader i {n} år. Resultatet bruger det, der reelt er plads til." |

> The allowlist is intentionally tiny for v1 — under the simple input mapping
> (`toScenarioInputs`), most checks are unreachable (holding, debt, life events, part-time,
> state pension, annuity are all zeroed/off). `planned-over-cashflow` is the one check that
> is both reachable and publicly meaningful. New entries are added deliberately, each with
> reviewed plain-Danish copy — never by surfacing checks wholesale.

**Explicitly filtered out (must never surface publicly), with the reason:**

| id(s) | Category to filter |
|---|---|
| `sp-manual-high` | Folkepension / DK state pension |
| `private-pension-note` | Pension jargon (ratepension / livsvarig / tax rates) |
| `exit-far`, `holding-overlap`, `holding-dependency`, `holding-financing-short`, `holding-debt-external` | Holding / business capital (incl. text referencing the "No Barma" stress test) |
| `parttime-low-gross`, `parttime-late-start` | Deltid / part-time + familiefond income |
| `liab-double-*` | Debt / personal-liability double-counting (advanced) |
| `unallocated-cashflow` | References the internal **audit panel** |
| `savings-logic-explain` | Internal savings-logic explainer (jargon, not a warning) |
| `le-*` (all life-event checks) | Life events — not in the simple surface |

**Filter rule (robust to new checks):** default-deny — drop anything not on the allowlist —
**and** additionally hard-block any check whose `id`, `title`, or `detail` references the
advanced/DK/internal vocabulary: *Folkepension, Holding, "No Barma", Barma, ASK, ratepension,
livrente, livsvarig, deltid, familiefond, exit, audit-panel(et), stress-test*. This keeps a
newly-added engine check from leaking onto the public path before it has reviewed public copy.

### 4.5 Public-safe robustness-drivers adapter

The robustness card's "what helps / what hurts" must **not** point at raw `robustnessBreakdown`.
`deriveKPIs` always pushes advanced/internal factors into that list regardless of the simple
inputs — in particular:

- a **holding-dependency** factor ("Lav/Moderat/Høj afhængighed af holding", detail "Holding
  udgør X % af slutaktiverne") — pushed unconditionally, so it shows even when holding = 0;
- a **cash-buffer** factor ("Lav/OK/Solid kontant buffer") — pushed unconditionally, and since
  the simple surface has no buffer input (`cashBuffer = 0`) it always reads "Lav kontant
  buffer / 0,0 måneders forbrug", nagging about something the public user can't set;
- end-margin factors whose copy references "minimumsmål" even when the user set no FI target.

**Important structural caveat:** unlike `SanityCheck`, a `ScoreFactor` has **no stable `id`** —
only `label` / `detail` / `impact` / `magnitude`, and the labels embed dynamic numbers. So the
adapter must **not** match on label text. Two robust options (the implementation PR picks one):

1. **Preferred — compose public drivers from already-public KPI fields**, not from
   `robustnessBreakdown` at all: derive "what helps/hurts" from `firstShortfallAge` /
   monthly bottleneck gap (cashflow coverage), end-of-horizon capital vs. `fiTargetMinNetWorth`
   (end margin), and the headline `financialRobustness`. This sidesteps the no-`id` problem
   entirely.
2. **Or — classify factors into a small set of public "families"** by their known origin in
   `kpis.ts` and apply a **default-deny allowlist** of families, each with reviewed Danish copy.

**Allowlist of public driver families** (default-deny — anything not listed is dropped):

| Driver family (origin in `kpis.ts`) | Public Danish copy (indicative) |
|---|---|
| Cashflow coverage — positive ("Ingen cashflow-shortfall") | "Dit forbrug er dækket hele perioden." |
| Cashflow coverage — negative ("Cashflow-shortfall ved alder X" / "Månedligt hul efter stop") | "Pengene slipper op ved alder {X}." / "Du mangler i gennemsnit {G} kr/md efter stop." |
| End-of-horizon margin ("Komfortabel slutmargin" / "Lav margin …") | "Du har god margin ved planperiodens slutning." / "Der er kun lille margin ved planperiodens slutning." Mention a target only when `fiTargetMinNetWorth` is set. |

**Explicitly filtered out (never public):**

| Driver family | Reason |
|---|---|
| Holding-dependency ("… afhængighed af holding", "Holding udgør X %") | Advanced / business capital — present even when holding = 0 |
| Cash-buffer ("… kontant buffer") | Buffer is not in the simple input surface; always reads "lav" and can't be acted on |
| Concentration / part-time source factors | Advanced / deltid |
| Minimumsmål-not-met critical factor | Only meaningful with an FI target; rephrase via the end-margin family, never raw |

**Filter rule (mirrors §4.4):** default-deny on family, **and** hard-block any factor whose
`label`/`detail` references *holding, buffer, kontant buffer, deltid, ASK, koncentration,
minimumsmål* (unless an FI target is set) — so a newly-added engine factor can't leak before
it has reviewed public copy.

> **Same treatment applies to `confidenceBreakdown`.** It is not shown in the MVP (only the
> `assumptionConfidence` score is). If a future PR surfaces assumption drivers, they must pass
> an equivalent adapter: allow `returns`, `spending`, `salary`; filter `familyFund`,
> `statePension`, `ratePension`, `lifeAnnuity`, `holdingExit` (advanced/DK), and drop factors
> flagged "Bruges ikke i scenariet".

## 5. Copy direction (Danish)

Tone: **calm, plain, trustworthy, practical.** Not advice, not jargon, not salesy, no false
precision. Short sentences. Never show personal names (Barma) or unexplained Danish acronyms
(ASK, AM-bidrag, 27/42) on the public path. Currency is `kr`; amounts are nutidskroner.

**Public copy voice (the rule).** This is the canonical voice for every Danish user-facing
string. It is mirrored in `CLAUDE.md` §3 rule 8.

- Plain, human Danish. Sentence case, short, active voice. Name things by what the person
  controls, not by how the system works.
- No em dashes. Use commas or full stops.
- Avoid classic AI phrasings and filler.
- Show the actual computed figures, formatted in Danish convention (period as thousands
  separator, whole kroner, e.g. 3.486.500 kr). Do not hedge figures with "ca." and do not
  round them into vagueness.
- Handle model uncertainty once, globally, with a single calm disclaimer (not per number):
  *"En forenklet beregning ud fra dine egne tal og antagelser. Tag tallene som et kvalificeret
  billede, ikke en garanti, og ikke som økonomisk rådgivning."*
- Honest and reassuring, never salesy or alarmist.

Principles:
- **Every headline number gets one explaining sentence.** A number with no sentence is not ready.
- **Actual figures, not vague ones.** Show the real computed number in Danish convention
  (e.g. 3.486.500 kr); never prefix it with "ca." and never round it into vagueness.
- **One global disclaimer, not per number.** Handle model uncertainty once: *"En forenklet
  beregning ud fra dine egne tal og antagelser. Tag tallene som et kvalificeret billede, ikke
  en garanti, og ikke som økonomisk rådgivning."*
- **Real terms, stated once, clearly:** *"Alle beløb er i nutidskroner (dagens købekraft)."*
- **Plain bottleneck language**, not engine terms: *"flaskehals"* not *"cashflow-shortfall"*.

Example labels / microcopy (indicative — final copy is a later pass):

| Context | Danish copy |
|---|---|
| App brand | **Frihedsmodel** |
| Intro headline | "Hvornår kan du blive økonomisk fri?" |
| Intro sub | "Få et estimat på få minutter. Se, hvad der betyder mest." |
| Start CTA | "Kom i gang" |
| Result CTA | "Se mit resultat" |
| Status: valid | "På sporet" |
| Status: tight / target_missed | "Stramt" |
| Status: invalid | "Ikke på sporet" |
| Headline answer | "Du kan tidligst stoppe ved alder {X}." |
| No FI age yet | "Med de nuværende tal er du ikke på sporet endnu." |
| Capital at stop | "{N} kr ved din planlagte stop-alder." |
| Bottleneck | "Fra alder {Y} mangler du {G} kr/md." |
| No bottleneck | "Ingen flaskehals fundet, planen holder hele vejen." |
| Robustness | "Hvor solid er planen?" |
| Confidence | "Hvor meget afhænger resultatet af optimistiske antagelser?" |
| Levers nudge | "Prøv at justere forbrug, opsparing eller stop-alder og se effekten." |
| Disclaimer (single, global) | "En forenklet beregning ud fra dine egne tal og antagelser. Tag tallene som et kvalificeret billede, ikke en garanti, og ikke som økonomisk rådgivning." |
| Real terms note | "Alle beløb er i nutidskroner." |

## 6. Suggested first implementation PR after this spec

Per `docs/public-mvp-scope-v1.md` §9 and the roadmap, the input mapping (PR #12) already
exists. The natural **next PR** is the first piece of public UI:

**`feat/public-onboarding-and-result-v1` — guided simple-input flow + answer-first result**
- **Goal:** build Screens B and C (§3) over the existing `simpleInputs` mapping: the
  one-screen simple form (pre-filled from `DEFAULT_SIMPLE_INPUTS`) and the answer-first
  result hero (status badge + earliest sustainable stop age + headline takeaway + projection
  chart), reading `KPIs` via the existing `project`/`deriveKPIs` pipeline. Includes the
  UI-side adapters from §4.4 (status→public-copy mapping; default-deny warnings allowlist)
  **and §4.5 (drivers adapter)**, horizon-relative capital anchors with the §4.0 **R1**
  boundary guards (incl. the pension-access-age guard + fallbacks and the `capitalAtStopAge`
  in-horizon guard from §4.2), and the first-bottleneck gap sourced from the first shortfall
  `YearRow` (`shortfallAmount / 12`), not `monthlyGapAfterStop`. Every age-anchored and
  list/text output must satisfy the two cross-cutting rules in §4.0.
- **Scope guardrails:** UI only. No engine, persistence, or data-format changes. Reuse the
  store and mapping; do not fork engine logic. Keep advanced/DK concepts off the path
  (CLAUDE.md §3). Use Danish copy per §5.
- **Tests:** Playwright smoke of the public journey (form → result renders, no blank/error),
  plus presence checks for the headline number and status badge. No weakening of existing tests.
- **Risk:** medium (new UI surface), low model risk (additive, mapping already tested).
- **Defers to later PRs:** live levers (Screen D), trust/explanation copy depth, save/export
  (Screen E), hiding/debug-gating advanced routes, sensitivity/top-drivers polish — each its
  own focused PR per scope §9.

A small earlier/parallel PR is also reasonable if preferred: a **Claude Design visual
concept** (Phase 4) built directly from §3 + §4 before writing the onboarding UI, so the
UI PR has a visual target.

## 7. Open questions

- **Surplus policy:** the simple mapping leaves surplus beyond `monthlySavings` un-invested
  (`outOfModel`). Should the public MVP auto-invest surplus (`investExtra`)? (Flagged in
  `simpleInputs.ts`; product decision, would change result numbers — needs tests.)
- **Input validation/clamping:** not implemented in `simpleInputs.ts`; ranges in §4.1 are
  guidance only. Where does validation live (UI vs. mapping) and what are the enforced bounds?
  (Phase 7 item.)
- **"Tight" status:** scope mentions a "tight / lige på vippen" state; the engine exposes
  `valid | target_missed | invalid`. Confirm the mapping (likely `target_missed` → "tight").
- **Anchors & adapters (resolved in this revision):** the public surface uses horizon-relative
  anchors (stop/FI age, pension access age, end of horizon) bounded to `[currentAge,
  lifeExpectancy]` per §4.0 R1 — including the pension-access-age guard + fallbacks and the
  `capitalAtStopAge` in-horizon guard. The end-of-horizon card is sourced from the **last
  `YearRow`** (net worth at `lifeExpectancy`), not `capitalAt95`; the fixed-age KPIs
  `capitalAt65` (silent 0 out of horizon) and `capitalAt95` (the age-95 figure when
  `lifeExpectancy ≥ 95`) are never used as anchors. All raw engine lists/text go through
  public-safe adapters per §4.0 R2:
  warnings + status (§4.4) and robustness drivers (§4.5), with `confidenceBreakdown` reserved
  for the same treatment if ever surfaced. Remaining engine-side nicety (later, optional):
  rename `capitalAt95`/`capitalAt65` in the engine to horizon-relative names so the field
  names stop implying fixed ages — an engine change with tests, out of scope for this docs PR.
- **Net vs. gross income input:** the engine takes gross salary; a public user may think in
  net. Do we add a net→gross presentation step now or defer to a locale/tax layer? (Noted in
  scope §3.)
